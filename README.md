# Data Engineer Resources

💡 Hey there! Welcome to our Data Engineering Resources!

> We've got you covered whether you're just starting out or you're already a pro. 

> In this guide, we'll take you through the basics of Data Engineering, to then move on to more complicated topics. So, whether you're a complete newbie or you're an expert looking to brush up on your skills, this guide is perfect for you. Let's get started!

## 🏁 **Let’s start with** Basics! (Beginner level)

### 🚀 Introduction To Big Data Analysis
    
> Data Engineers come into play when companies needs to handle in a reproducible way large amounts of data so that they can then be streamlined to data analysts and scientists in order to understand past trends and make predictions. 

But first of all what is Big Data?

Let's check some **Big Data Analysis Resources!** 👉🏻  https://pierpaolo28.github.io/blog/blog10/

When working with large amounts of data it can then become impossible to perform any form of analysis on a single machine and that’s why using hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs, IPUs, etc…) or parallelizing execution across a cluster of machines is fundamental.

**Gpu Accelerated Data Analytics & Machine Learning** 👉🏻 https://pierpaolo28.github.io/blog/blog12/

Once having become familiar with the different kinds of acceleration techniques, it can then be possible to create ad hoc benchmarks to evaluate which approach might be best for your own use case.

A good resource in order to gain a birds-eye view of the Data Engineering landscape is “**Fundamentals of Data Engineering**” by Joe Reis and Matt Housley or the “Data Engineering Zoomcamp” by **Alexey Grigorev**.

### 🐍 Python
    
> Nowadays Python is indubitably one of the most ubiquitous programming languages when working with Data. Therefore it vital to have some familiarity with it in order to work in the data space:
    
**Learn Python - Free Interactive Python Tutorial** 👉🏻 https://www.learnpython.org/
    
Once having learned the basics, we can then start focusing on how to write efficient code in Python:
    
**Efficient Python Tricks and Tools for Data Scientists — Effective Python for Data Scientists** 👉🏻 https://khuyentran1401.github.io/Efficient_Python_tricks_and_tools_for_data_scientists/README.html
    
In order to create reproducible code and avoid libraries versioning issues, it is then necessary to understand how environments can be created and managed in Python and when using Anaconda:

### 💾 SQL

> As a Data Engineer, you might act as an interface between Database Engineers and the Data Analysts/Scientists teams, therefore a good knowledge of SQL to interact with databases can be expected.

**Sql For Data Science** 👉🏻 https://pierpaolo28.github.io/blog/blog22/

If you are new to SQL, you can lean about all the basics here: **SQLBolt - Learn SQL - Introduction to SQL** 👉🏻 https://sqlbolt.com/

There exist many different types of database systems (e.g. MySQL, Postgresql), each with its own specific dialect, therefore having cheatsheets with a summary of the key commands can be of great help when switching from one system to another.

**Postgresql Commands** 👉🏻 https://pierpaolo28.github.io/blog/tips/PostgreSQL-Commands/

**BONUS POINT:**

If you want to dig deeper on how SQL works, why not create your own dialect?

Now that you know how to use SQL to retrieve and manipulate data from databases, what if you get asked to design one or to create new content?

There exist different databases design practices and considerations to be taken into account. 

You can learn more about them here:

Database design basics - Microsoft Support 👉🏻 https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/database-design-basics-eb2159cf-1e30-401a-8084-bd4f9c9ca1f5)

Designing your database schema — best practices 👉🏻 https://towardsdatascience.com/designing-your-database-schema-best-practices-31843dc78a8d)

Additionally, databases can be not just relational but also non-relational in order to be more flexible to store different kinds of data. Although each approach comes with its own advantages and limitations.

## Apache Spark
    
Apache Spark is one of the most popular frameworks to work with big data and therefore used by a large number of big organizations. 

> Apache Spark can support different coding interfaces such as Python, SQL, Java, and Scala.

For a complete guide on **“Learning Spark”**, Databricks also offers the complete book for free 👉🏻 https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/LearningSpark2.0.pdf)
    
## Cloud Computing

As more and more companies move from using on-premises resources to the cloud, it has become more and more important to learn about Cloud Computing.

If interested in learning more about Docker and Kubernetees, cheatsheets are available below:
    
Docker Commands 👉🏻 https://pierpaolo28.github.io/blog/tips/Docker-Commands/
    
Kubernetes Commands 👉🏻  https://pierpaolo28.github.io/blog/tips/Kubernetes-Commands/
    
While working with cloud-based systems, there are different paradigms which can be used in order to store data such as Databases, Data Warehouses and Data Lakes. You can learn more about them in the following article:

The 3 most popular cloud computing platoforms are Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Serivces (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

Each of these 3 providers offers a wide range of free course and documentation material in order to get you started with your learning some example are:
