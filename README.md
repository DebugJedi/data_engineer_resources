## 🏁 **Let’s start with** Basics! (Beginner level)

### Introduction To Big Data Analysis
    
Data Engineers come into play when companies needs to handle in a reproducible way large amounts of data so that they can then be streamlined to data analysts and scientists in order to understand past trends and make predictions. 

But first of all what is Big Data?

Let's check some **Big Data Analysis Resources!** 👇🏼 https://pierpaolo28.github.io/blog/blog10/

When working with large amounts of data it can then become impossible to perform any form of analysis on a single machine and that’s why using hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs, IPUs, etc…) or parallelizing execution across a cluster of machines is fundamental.

Once having become familiar with the different kinds of acceleration techniques, it can then be possible to create ad hoc benchmarks to evaluate which approach might be best for your own use case.

A good resource in order to gain a birds-eye view of the Data Engineering landscape is “**Fundamentals of Data Engineering**” by Joe Reis and Matt Housley or the “Data Engineering Zoomcamp” by **Alexey Grigorev**.
